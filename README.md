# About
@tgchessbot is a Telegram bot. You can play chess using @tgchessbot. To play with friends, create a group and invite @tgchessbot into it. If you wish to play alone, talk to @tgchessbot on a 1-on-1 private message.

# Hosting @tgchessbot on your own server

* Register a bot with the [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
* After installing `Python3` and `pip` on a server, perform the following:

```
sudo pip3 install telepot
sudo pip3 install python-chess
sudo pip3 install Pillow
sudo pip3 install cairosvg
```

* Install `stockfish` chess engine on your linux console using the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install stockfish
```

* Download the code from my [Github repo](https://github.com/mahdavifar2002/tgchessbot)
* Replace the `telegram_bot_token` variable (near the bottom of `tgchessbot.py`) with your own bot token from BotFather
* Shoot up a `screen` and run `python3 tgchessbot.py`. Detach using `Ctrl + A + D`. The bot will continue running and handle messages in the background as long as your server is up.
